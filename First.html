The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman <strong>Lisa Gherardini,</strong>the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white <strong>Lombardy poplar panel.</strong> Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice <strong><u>Salaì</u></strong>
<p> It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic.</p><br>
